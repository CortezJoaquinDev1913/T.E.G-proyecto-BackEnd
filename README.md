# T.E.G-proyecto-BackEnd
Hello, in this section you will be able to see the project I developed using development technologies such as Java, Angular, and PostgreeSQL. The project is none other than T.E.G (Tactical and Strategic Warfare). It is an Argentine board game. It presents a war conflict that takes place on a world map divided into 50 countries, presented on cards, chosen at random.
